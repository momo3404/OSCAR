# OSCAR

OSCAR is a discord bot whose name stands for Online School Communication Assistant Robot. The goal of this project was to create a discord bot that would assist with tasks that 
students in online school would find helpful. This includes things such as playing music while studying, creating a to-do list of tasks, creating reminders, and using google
to search up images.
